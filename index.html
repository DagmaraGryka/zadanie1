                <p>This is the first day of my life<br>
                    Swear I was born right in the doorway<br>
                    I went out in the rain, suddenly everything changed<br>
                    They're spreading blankets on the beach<br>
                    <br>
                    Yours was the first face that I saw<br>
                    I think I was blind before I met you<br>
                    I don't know where I am, I don't know where I've been<br>
                    But I know where I want to go<br>
                    <br>
                    And so I'd thought I'd let you know<br>
                    That these things take forever, I especially am slow<br>
                    But I realized that need you<br>
                    And I wondered if I could come home<br>
                    <br>
                    I remember the time you drove all night<br>
                    Just to meet me in the morning<br>
                    And I thought it was strange, you said everything changed<br>
                    You felt as if you just woke up</p>
